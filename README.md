# Cardiomegaly Classification 

Overview
The Cardiomegaly Classification system is designed to classify chest X-ray images into categories related to the presence or absence of cardiomegaly. This documentation provides information on the dataset, model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics.

Dataset
NIH CXR8 Dataset
The NIH CXR8 dataset is a collection of chest X-ray images curated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It consists of images labeled with various thoracic pathology categories, including cardiomegaly. The dataset is widely used for training and evaluating deep learning models for medical image analysis.

Model Architecture
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
The Cardiomegaly Classification model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network architecture. CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks as they can automatically learn hierarchical representations from images.

Model Layers:
Input Layer: Accepts chest X-ray images of fixed dimensions.
Convolutional Layers: Extract features from input images.
Pooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions and retain important features.
Fully Connected Layers: Make predictions based on learned features.
Output Layer: Produces probability scores for the presence or absence of cardiomegaly.
Training
The model is trained using a supervised learning approach. The training process involves:

Data Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation of input images.
Model Compilation: Choosing an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric.
Training: Iteratively updating model weights using labeled training data.
Validation: Assessing model performance on a separate validation set to avoid overfitting.
Evaluation Metrics
The Cardiomegaly Classification model is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The percentage of correctly classified images.
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive cases.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.
Conclusion
The Cardiomegaly Classification system aims to assist in the automated classification of cardiomegaly in chest X-ray images. Regular updates to the model and retraining on additional data may improve its performance over time.
